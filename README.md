    IPAuthenticator is a lightweight Spigot plugin that streamlines your server's whitelist process by automatically verifying player IPs. Gain peace of mind knowing only authorized users can join, while still offering flexibility with configuration options.

    Key Features:
        - Effortless Whitelisting: Simply add allowed IPs or whole IP-Range to the config file.
        - Kick Unauthorized Players: Players with unrecognized IPs are automatically kicked with a customizable message.
        - Whitelist on Join (Optional): Optionally, players with approved IPs can be automatically added to the whitelist for future joins.
        - Bypass Whitelist on Login (Optional): Configure the plugin to allow already whitelisted players to bypass the IP check altogether.
        - Configurable Messages: Tailor the kick message to inform unauthorized players and optionally notify new whitelisted users.
        - Permission: Bypass the IP-whitelist with permission "ipauthenticator.bypass"
